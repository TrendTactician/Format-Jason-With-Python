# JSON Formatter
A simple Python script to format JSON files. This tool reads an input file containing one or more JSON objects (even if they're not wrapped in an array), formats them with proper indentation, and writes the formatted JSON data to an output file.

## Features
Multiple JSON Objects Handling: Automatically processes files containing multiple JSON objects by wrapping them in a list.

Readable Output: Outputs formatted JSON with customizable indentation for better readability.

Error Handling: Includes error handling for file not found issues, invalid JSON formats, and other exceptions.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## Usage
Run the script using Python:

```python json_formatter.py```

**You will be prompted to enter:**

1. The path to the input JSON file.

2. The path to save the formatted JSON file.

Example:

```Enter the path to the input JSON file: data/input.json```

```Enter the path to save the formatted JSON file: data/output.json```

After processing, you will see a confirmation message indicating that the formatted JSON has been written to the specified output file.

## How It Works
**1. Reading the File:**
- The script reads the entire content of the input file using UTF-8 encoding.

**2. Processing Multiple JSON Objects:**
- It attempts to decode the content iteratively. If multiple JSON objects are present and are not wrapped in an array, the script wraps them in a list.

**3. Formatting:**
- The JSON data is formatted with a 4-space indentation for improved readability.

**4. Error Handling:**
- The script handles errors gracefully, providing meaningful messages for:

```File not found```

```JSON decode errors```

```General exceptions```

## Potential Use Cases

**1. Extracting Large JSON Files:**
- Automatically format large files containing multiple JSON objects for easier reading and debugging.

**2. Log File Processing:**
- Format JSON logs generated by applications or servers, making it simpler to analyze error messages and events.

**3. Data Pipeline Preparation:**
- Pre-process JSON data before feeding it into data analysis or transformation pipelines.

**4. Debugging JSON Data:**
- Quickly reformat JSON output from APIs or web services to spot errors or verify structure.

**5. Integration Testing:**
- Format JSON payloads used in tests to ensure consistency and readability in test reports.

**6. Data Migration:**
- Clean and format JSON data extracted from legacy systems before importing it into a new system.

**7. Configuration File Management:**
- Format and beautify JSON configuration files for easier modification and verification.

Each of these use cases benefits from having clean, human-readable JSON, which can reduce errors and improve maintainability in various workflows.
